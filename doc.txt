Hey guys! 
Thanks for sending over the contract, we had a quick review and just had a few questions or comments :-)
1- 
How do we do for the deposit ? Is there a deposit-account that the landlord will provide ? Should we write something about this in the contract ? 
2-
As we discussed during the visit , it would make sense that we do a Wohnungsübergabe to document what you guys leave here, and the state of the flat, right ? 
3-
Out of curiosity, did the tenants before you do the "Service Geschirspüller and Waschmaschine" when you moved in ? 

Also, we have printed and signed 5 copies of the contract :D can we give you your copies of the contract when we meet next time and send you a scan of one for now ?
